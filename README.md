# ⚛️ React Testimonials Clon ⚛️

This is a simple clon of FreeCodeCamp testimonials. I did it like a part of their React's course and It is not like a finished project, It's just a simple no responsive page to understand some React's bases. The code is in spanish and without comments because I was following and understanding the steps, but not coding by myself.
